    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
        I've been learning and working in Machine Learning for three years. I hold a B. Eng
        in Electrical Engineering, and my internship experience is in Machine Learning driven
        projects. I'm currently working towards an M. Eng with a specialization in Software 
        Engineering. My ultimate goal is work in the MLOps space, deploying and scaling 
        Machine Learning systems. 
      </p>
      <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
        During my first internship, I worked at the Canadian Space Agency. As an intern, I developed a 
        Machine Learning system to find events in the ionosphere using electron density data 
        recorded by satellites.
      </p>
      <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
        For my second internship, I worked as a Machine Learning Developer at AltaML. There, I developed
        a system to summarize oil and gas site maintenance documents using OCR and Large Language Models.
