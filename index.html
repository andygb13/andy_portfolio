    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      I've been learning and working in Software projects for three years. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering
      in Electrical Engineering, and my internship experience is in Machine Learning driven
      projects. I'm currently working towards a Masters of Engineering with specialization in Software
      Engineering.
    </p>
    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      During my first internship, I worked at the Canadian Space Agency. As an intern, I developed a
      Machine Learning system to find events in the ionosphere using electron density data
      recorded by satellites.
    </p>
    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      For my second internship, I worked as a Machine Learning Developer at AltaML. There, I developed
      a system to summarize oil and gas site maintenance documents using OCR and Large Language Models.

    <h3>Human Emotions Classification using Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>This project was completed as part of my undergraduate capstone project. It consisted in training a custom YOLOv5
      object detector to detect human eye pairs, and training a ResNet-50 classifier to classifiy human emotions. This
      reposity is designed to showcase these functionalities on an input video. See video sample below:

    <h3>Electroencephalography (EEG) Data Classification</h3>
    <p>
      This repository details a process for classifying EEG data using Principal Component Analysis. It includes loading
      and preprocessing EEG data, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA. The notebook also explores two machine
      learning models, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Random Forest, to classify the reduced EEG data, highlighting
      their moderate accuracy and class bias tendencies. Additionally, a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
      is implemented and trained, showing an improving trend in accuracy but potential overfitting issues, as indicated
      by the performance disparity between training and validation datasets.
