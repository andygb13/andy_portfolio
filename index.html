    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      I've been learning and working in Machine Learning for three years. I hold a B. Eng
      in Electrical Engineering, and my internship experience is in Machine Learning driven
      projects. I'm currently working towards an M. Eng with a specialization in Software
      Engineering. My ultimate goal is work in the MLOps space, deploying and scaling
      Machine Learning systems.
    </p>
    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      During my first internship, I worked at the Canadian Space Agency. As an intern, I developed a
      Machine Learning system to find events in the ionosphere using electron density data
      recorded by satellites.
    </p>
    <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
      For my second internship, I worked as a Machine Learning Developer at AltaML. There, I developed
      a system to summarize oil and gas site maintenance documents using OCR and Large Language Models.
